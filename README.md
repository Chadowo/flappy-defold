# Flappy Defold

Flappy Bird made in [Defold](https://defold.com/). Also my first game ever in this engine, so
the implementation may be sloppy, I don't know yet most of the common practices and such for
Defold.

## How to Load

Simply clone this repo and choose **Open From Disk...** in the project selection screen of Defold.
