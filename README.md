# Flappy Defold

Flappy Bird made in [Defold](https://defold.com/). Also my first game ever in this engine, so
the implementation may be sloppy.

## What's Here

The game's implemented pretty naively I think? I'm not really familiar with how Flappy Bird is generally
implemented but atleast it just worksâ„¢.

The main collection is the principal one as you may have guessed, and it works by using collection proxies
to load the other collections (in this case, the game and menu collections).

It should work fine on both desktop and mobile platforms, it also has adaptive icons for Android too.

## TODO

- Transitions.
- Tweaking some effects.

## Play It

You can play it right in your browser from the itch.io page.
